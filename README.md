## University of Toronto Course Review (iOS Platform)
Udacity iOS Nano Degree Project 5 - "Your Decide!"
## Motivation of the project
As university students, course enrollments are critical. Some courses inspires students for their future career and research area. Some however, not that useful and/or not worth taking in certain situation. To find out whether a course is valuable, one convenient way is to hear what past students have to say about it. Are they interest? hard? and most importantly, are they useful?

## Introduction
University of Toronto Course Review (UTCR) is based on this thought and is designed specifically for the campus i'm studying at - University of Toronto. It has both iOS version and website version http://utcr.flowintent.com/#/. Similar to "Rate My Professor", this platform gives student chance to find out detail description for courses provided by University of Toronto. Students can also read any comments others made, as well as post their own comment based on their thoughts and experience. Comments including student's personal thought, professor who taught him/her, and rating of the course (hardness, usefulness and attractiveness).

For this iOS App, student can further add/remove courses into/from their favorite list as a reference for course enrollment.
